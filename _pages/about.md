I am currently an junior EE student from Fudan University. I have devoted myself to distributed machine learning system research and innovation since my experience in developing a distributed SQL machine learning system.

My research interests include design and optimization of distributed machine learning systems, programming languages and physical acceleration of machine learning.

I have been admitted to Department of Computer Science, The University of Hong Kong. I will become a Ph.D. student in 2022.
