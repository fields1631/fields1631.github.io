We develop an ECG real time recognition system. We adopt ADS1293, an low power, 3-channel, 24-bit analog front end to collect ECG signal and we utilize Arduino Mega's SPI interface to recieve ECG signal from ADS1293 and send to computer. Then we filter and frame the signal, feed frames to random forest classifier and get the classification result.
