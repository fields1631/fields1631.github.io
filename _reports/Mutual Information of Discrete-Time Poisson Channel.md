Due to difficulties in mathematical calculations, there is currently no accurate channel capacity expression for Discrete-Time Poisson Channel, which limits the application of Poisson channels in more scenarios. We research in the mutual information range of Discrete-Time Poisson Channel under Q-PAM modulation.

We use Taylor expansion to approach the mutual information and we give a general method to calculate the upper and lower bound of mutual information of arbitrary precision. A precise error analysis shows that the expression can adapt to different modulation parameteres well.
