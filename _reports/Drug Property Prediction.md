We use machine learning methods to predict activity of drug molecules. We construct a Self-Attention Bidirectioinal LSTM model and some ensemble models. These models out-perform conventional models and reach roc-aucs up to 0.98 and prc-aucs up to 0.78.

Based on our research in drug property prediction with machine learning methods, we present a report **[Property Prediction Briefing](pdfs/property%20prediction%20briefing.pdf)** in class and recieve a high rank.
