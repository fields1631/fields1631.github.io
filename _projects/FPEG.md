We develop **[FPEG](https://github.com/fields1631/fpeg)**, an extensive, zero config, multiprocess accelerating programming framework for constructing image processing algorithms.

The framework mainly consists of Pipeline, which pratice image processing algorithms and use variant metrics to evaluate the result. Pipeline naturally supports parallel processing, and its monitor component collect all the input and output of pipe components, making it easy for debugging and testing.

The framework is written by Ye Tian, Run Wang and ZhengQuan Zhang. Visit our **[report](FPEG/fpeg.pdf)** for more information.
